Congratulations! You Graduated!

Since I'm terrible at coming up with gifts to buy, I decided instead to just
make a game and give that as a gift instead. So this is my little graduation
game. Let me explain how it works:

(first off, you'll need the Unity Web Player in order for it to run)

The .html file is the actual game. I made a web build so it would work on any
computer, since it plays in a web browser.

The object is simple: There are 11 yellow squares that you need to collect in
order to win. However, every time you collect one, a purple sphere will spawn
above you, and come chasing after you. If a sphere touches you, it's game
over, and you'll reset form the beginning. 

WASD - Movement
Space - Jump
Mouse - Look around

Have fun!
